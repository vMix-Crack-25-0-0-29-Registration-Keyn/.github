#### **3. Advanced Triggers for Playback**
vMix 2025 introduces **two new triggers** for controlling playback behavior during video transitions:

- **OnPlaybackTimeRemaining**: Similarly, this trigger can activate an action at a specified time before the video ends, helping to automate various production tasks based on playback timing.

These features provide greater automation and precision, streamlining live production workflows.

#### **4. Application Audio Capture**
One of the most significant updates in vMix 2025 is the ability to capture **audio directly from applications**.
